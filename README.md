># Work Experience<br/>
Thus far, most of my work experience has been in the construction industry, both on site building construction,<br/> 
and in-shop fabrication of building materials. My experience has also included training in and implimentation of health and safety<br/>
protocals. <br/>
<br/>
In the last few years I have directed my focus on furthering my education and experience in English language teaching.<br/> 
So far, my experience has been in volunteer positions teaching English at an elementary level.

># Travel and Culture Experience<br />
From a young age I have had an interest in other countries and cultures. At the age of 17 I made my first overseas trip to Russia.<br/>
In the years that followed I made trips to Iceland, China, Malaysia, Nepal, and other Asian countries. My experiences in these places<br/>
broadened my horizons and shaped my outlook on life. I came to realize that there were different ways of looking at life and at the world<br/>
that differed from the way I was used to seeing things. These perspectives have helped me to see the world as a beautiful tapestry<br/>
and that together with other cultures we each enrich the world in our own way. It has been an amazing experience to work together with<b/>
people from many backgrounds and to learn to love and appreciate their unique contribution to the whole of humankind.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that these experiences and new outlook help me to be able to better build relationships and relate to people from other cultures.<br/>
These intercultural skills are a beneficial asset to businesses and organizations looking to work in areas where cultural differences can<br/> 
be a critical factor.<br/>

># Vision<br/>
With a degree in English Communication and certification in TEFL, I hope to be able to assist those in rural areas who desire<br/> 
to benefit their communities through raising the standard of education. By equipping local people and assisting them<br/>
in ways they feel are needed, I hope to bolster local potential and realize local dreams for a better future.
