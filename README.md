># Work Experience<br/>
Thus far, most of my work experience has been in the construction industry, both on site building construction,<br/> 
and in-shop fabrication of building materials. My experience has also included training in and implimentation of health and safety<br/>
protocals. <br/>
<br/>
In the last few years I have directed my focus on furthering my education and experience in English language teaching.<br/> 
So far, my experience has been in volunteer positions teaching English at an elementary level.

># Vision<br/>
With a degree in English Communication and certification in TEFL, I hope to be able to assist those in rural areas who desire<br/> 
to benefit their communities through raising the standard of education. By equipping local people and assisting them<br/>
in ways they feel are needed, I hope to bolster local potential and realize local dreams for a better future.
