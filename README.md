># Work Experience<br/>
While most of my career work experience has been in the construction industry, I have had the opportunity to engage in other experience that helped shape my abilities in public speaking and teaching. Since 2006 I have been involved in teaching in a church setting, teaching children from ages 5-13 and also teaching an adult Bible class for about 6 years.

># Faith<br/>
While I grew up in a wonderful Christian home, it wasn’t until I was in my teens that I was converted. Although through my upbringing I had been kept from many harmful influences, the change in my heart was significant and lasting. I came to know Jesus Christ in a personal way, and it has filled my life with joy and peace, and His love is continually transforming my life.
I believe that the Bible is the true word of God and in doctrines commonly accepted by Christians; the Trinity, salvation by faith in Christ for the remission of sins and receiving the Holy Spirit. I believe that a Christian will walk in holiness by the grace of God and throughout their lives they will grow into the likeness of Jesus.
The church that I am a part of is not associated with a denomination but believes in the things mentioned above.
